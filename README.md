This HTML code creates a simple stopwatch with a display and control buttons: "Start", "Stop", "Reset", and "Lap". The layout is responsive, with a dark background and shadow effects. Users can start, stop, and reset the timer, which shows hours, minutes, and seconds. The lap button records lap times displayed in a separate scrollable section. A "Clear" button removes all lap records. JavaScript handles the timer's functionality, updating every second, and allowing lap recording and resetting. The design is clean, centered, and visually appealing for a smooth user experience.
